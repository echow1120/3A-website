      It all starts with Merida discovering "the-will-of-the-wisps" (magic). The Magic turns her mother into a bear. This magic is why animals and inanimate objects (brooms & tools) behave like humans. Magic was utilized by a witch, who mysteriously vanishes through wooden doors.
      Eventually the Magic from the will of the wisps would lead to the birth of super heroes

    <h1 id="box2">INCREDIBLES</h1>
    Superheroes maintained order in the world. But Buddy, a wannabe superhero, created two things for the demise of superpowered humans: self serving A.I. bots like the "Omnidroid," and the high tech Zero Point Energy (electromagnetic energy that exists in a vacuum). This is the pivotal moment where we see machines eradicating their only threatâˆ’supers.
  Eventually, toys start to absorb and draw their powers from Zero Point Energy, unseen energy that travels in wavelengths

  <h1 id="box3">TOY STORY 1</h1>
    The first signs of life from toys are now present due to Syndrome's technological prowess. Toys (sentient objects) come up with a code of rules and learn that human love is another energy source, upon which they thrive.
These toys discover what happens to toys that are isolated from humans.

    <h1 id="box4">TOY STORY 2</h1>
    The toys discover that it is dangerous for them to be isolated from humans. We start to see inanimate objects question their purpose in life. For example, Jesse resents her owner, Emily, for abandoning her.
Resentment towards humans was not only carried by inanimate objects but by animals as well.

    <h1 id="box5">FINDING NEMO</h1>
    In the ocean we find that fish are incredibly advanced (they have schools, a network and freeway system). We discover that humans are polluting the earth and experimenting on them. Dory was one of the animals that was experimented on, which is why she is forgetful. There are signs of resentment growing towards humans for polluting the environment, stealing fish and caging them.
Animals begin to be more curious and carry more humanistic characteristics.
